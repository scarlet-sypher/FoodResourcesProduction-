                <p class="t_p">The main objectives of food resources production are to: </p>

                <ol>


                    <li><h4>Ensure food security :</h4> This means that everyone has access to enough safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs for an active and healthy life.</li>

                        
                        
                    <li><h4>Support sustainable livelihoods :</h4>   Food production provides livelihoods for millions of people around the world. Sustainable food production practices can help to ensure that farmers and other workers in the food system can earn a fair living and have decent working conditions.</li>
 
                    <li><h4>Protect the environment :</h4>   Food production can have a negative impact on the environment, such as deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable food production practices can help to minimize these impacts and to protect the environment for future generations.</li>

                        
                    <li><h4>Promote economic development :</h4>    Food production is a major sector of the economy in many countries. Sustainable food production can help to boost economic growth and create jobs.</li>

                </ol>

                

                    
                    
                    <p class="p1">In addition to these general objectives, there are also specific objectives for food resources production in different countries and regions. For example, in developing countries, a key objective of food resources production is to reduce poverty and malnutrition. In developed countries, a key objective may be to improve the quality and sustainability of the food supply.<br>

                    Achieving the objectives of food resources production requires a coordinated effort from governments, businesses, and civil society. Governments can play a role by setting policies that promote sustainable food production, such as providing incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices and investing in research and development. Businesses can play a role by adopting sustainable practices in their own operations and by working with their suppliers to improve the sustainability of their supply chains. Civil society can play a role by educating the public about the importance of sustainable food production and by advocating for policies that support it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    
                    <p class="p1">Further with this website we are trying to spread awarness about the importance of food as a resource not only as a part of our daily diet but considering every single aspects releated to it. <br> We have tried to cover every possible details in which food as a resource is playing vital role.</p></p>
