            <p>Food resources and production play an important role in sustaining human life and supporting global economies.Food resources consists of all the raw materials that are used to produce the food we consume. This includes crops like grains, fruits, and vegetables, as well as livestock and fisheries.Production involves the cultivation, harvesting, processing, and distribution of these resources to create a wide variety of food products.
                <br>
                <br>
                Efficient food production is vital to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. This process inv6olves a complex network of farmers, agricultural practices, food processing industries, transportation systems, and distribution channels. Sustainable practices are becoming increasingly important to ensure that food production remains viable in the long term while minimizing environmental impact.
                <br>
                <br>
                In recent years, issues like climate change, land degradation, and water scarcity have added challenges to food production. Innovations in agriculture, such as precision farming techniques and alternative protein sources, are being explored to address these issues and improve the resilience of our food systems. It is imperative that we continue to invest in sustainable food production methods to ensure food security for current and future generations</p>

                    <h3>Fact 1</h3>
                    <p>The most stolen food in the world is ‘cheese’. As per reports, 4 percent of the total cheese produced globally is stolen.</p>

                    <h3>Fact 2</h3>
                    <p> Peanuts can be used to make dynamite. The oil derived from peanuts can be processed to produce glycerol. This, in turn, can be used to make nitroglycerin, one of the constituents of dynamite.</p>

                    <p>The wax used to coat candies and cars is the same. Carnauba, also called Brazil wax and palm wax, is not only used to cover the little gummy candies, but also your cars to make them look shiny.</p>
